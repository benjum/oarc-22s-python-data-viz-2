A Camp near Forres.\\n\\n Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with\\n Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nWhat bloody man is that? He can report,\\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\\nThe newest state.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nThis is the sergeant\\nWho, like a good and hardy soldier, fought\\n’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend!\\nSay to the King the knowledge of the broil\\nAs thou didst leave it.\\n\\nSOLDIER.\\nDoubtful it stood;\\nAs two spent swimmers that do cling together\\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\\n(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\\nThe multiplying villainies of nature\\nDo swarm upon him) from the Western Isles\\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\\nAnd Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\\nShow’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;\\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,\\nWhich smok’d with bloody execution,\\nLike Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,\\nTill he fac’d the slave;\\nWhich ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\\nTill he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,\\nAnd fix’d his head upon our battlements.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\\n\\nSOLDIER.\\nAs whence the sun ’gins his reflection\\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\\nSo from that spring, whence comfort seem’d to come\\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\\nNo sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,\\nCompell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\\nWith furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,\\nBegan a fresh assault.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nDismay’d not this\\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\\n\\nSOLDIER.\\nYes;\\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\\nAs cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;\\nSo they\\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\\nI cannot tell—\\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\\nThey smack of honour both.—Go, get him surgeons.\\n\\n [_Exit Captain, attended._]\\n\\n Enter Ross and Angus.\\n\\nWho comes here?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nThe worthy Thane of Ross.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\\nThat seems to speak things strange.\\n\\nROSS.\\nGod save the King!\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nWhence cam’st thou, worthy thane?\\n\\nROSS.\\nFrom Fife, great King,\\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky\\nAnd fan our people cold.\\nNorway himself, with terrible numbers,\\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor,\\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\\nTill that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,\\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\\nPoint against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,\\nCurbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\\nThe victory fell on us.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nGreat happiness!\\n\\nROSS.\\nThat now\\nSweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;\\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch\\nTen thousand dollars to our general use.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nNo more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\\nOur bosom interest.

You seem to understand me,\\nBy each at once her choppy finger laying\\nUpon her skinny lips. You should be women,\\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\\nThat you are so.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSpeak, if you can;—what are you?\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\\n\\nSECOND WITCH.\\nAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\\n\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\nAll hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nGood sir, why do you start and seem to fear\\nThings that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,\\nAre ye fantastical, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partner\\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\\nThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\\nIf you can look into the seeds of time,\\nAnd say which grain will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\\nYour favours nor your hate.\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nHail!\\n\\nSECOND WITCH.\\nHail!\\n\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\nHail!\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nLesser than Macbeth, and greater.\\n\\nSECOND WITCH.\\nNot so happy, yet much happier.\\n\\nTHIRD WITCH.\\nThou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nStay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.\\nBy Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;\\nBut how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,\\nA prosperous gentleman; and to be king\\nStands not within the prospect of belief,\\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\\nWith such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you.\\n\\n [_Witches vanish._]\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nInto the air; and what seem’d corporal,\\nMelted as breath into the wind.\\nWould they had stay’d!\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nYour children shall be kings.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nYou shall be king.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nAnd Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nTo the selfsame tune and words.

As thick as tale\\nCame post with post; and everyone did bear\\nThy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,\\nAnd pour’d them down before him.\\n\\nANGUS.\\nWe are sent\\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\\nNot pay thee.\\n\\nROSS.\\nAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,\\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\\nFor it is thine.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nWhat, can the devil speak true?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\\nIn borrow’d robes?\\n\\nANGUS.\\nWho was the Thane lives yet,\\nBut under heavy judgement bears that life\\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d\\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\\nHe labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;\\nBut treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,\\nHave overthrown him.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\n[_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.\\n[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\\nPromis’d no less to them?\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nThat, trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes to win us to our harm,\\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;\\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray’s\\nIn deepest consequence.—\\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\n[_Aside._] Two truths are told,\\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\\nOf the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.—\\n[_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,\\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success,\\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:\\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair,\\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\\nShakes so my single state of man\\nThat function is smother’d in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nLook, how our partner’s rapt.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\n[_Aside._] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me\\nWithout my stir.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nNew honours come upon him,\\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\\nBut with the aid of use.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\n[_Aside._] Come what come may,\\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGive me your favour. My dull brain was wrought\\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\\nAre register’d where every day I turn\\nThe leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—\\nThink upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,\\nThe interim having weigh’d it, let us speak\\nOur free hearts each to other.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nVery gladly.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nTill then, enough.—Come, friends.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE IV.

But I have spoke\\nWith one that saw him die, who did report,\\nThat very frankly he confess’d his treasons,\\nImplor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth\\nA deep repentance. Nothing in his life\\nBecame him like the leaving it; he died\\nAs one that had been studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow’d\\nAs ’twere a careless trifle.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nThere’s no art\\nTo find the mind’s construction in the face:\\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built\\nAn absolute trust.\\n\\n Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus.\\n\\nO worthiest cousin!\\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\\nWas heavy on me. Thou art so far before,\\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\\nTo overtake thee.

A Room in Macbeth’s Castle.\\n\\n Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\n“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the\\nperfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I\\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which\\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\\ncoming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought\\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\\nmight’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\\ngreatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”\\n\\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\\nWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\\nIt is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness\\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\\nArt not without ambition, but without\\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,\\nThat which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;\\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\\nTo have thee crown’d withal.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nWhat is your tidings?\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThe King comes here tonight.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nThou’rt mad to say it.\\nIs not thy master with him? who, were’t so,\\nWould have inform’d for preparation.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nSo please you, it is true.

Come, you spirits\\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\\nAnd fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-full\\nOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood,\\nStop up th’ access and passage to remorse,\\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature\\nShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\\nTh’ effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts,\\nAnd take my milk for gall, your murd’ring ministers,\\nWherever in your sightless substances\\nYou wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,\\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell\\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\\nTo cry, “Hold, hold!”\\n\\n Enter Macbeth.\\n\\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor!\\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\\nThy letters have transported me beyond\\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\\nThe future in the instant.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nMy dearest love,\\nDuncan comes here tonight.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nAnd when goes hence?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nO, never\\nShall sun that morrow see!\\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\\nMay read strange matters.

The air\\nNimbly and sweetly recommends itself\\nUnto our gentle senses.\\n\\nBANQUO.\\nThis guest of summer,\\nThe temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\\nBy his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath\\nSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,\\nButtress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\\nhath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.\\nWhere they most breed and haunt, I have observ’d\\nThe air is delicate.\\n\\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nSee, see, our honour’d hostess!—\\nThe love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\\nWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\\nHow you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains,\\nAnd thank us for your trouble.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nAll our service,\\nIn every point twice done, and then done double,\\nWere poor and single business to contend\\nAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewith\\nYour Majesty loads our house: for those of old,\\nAnd the late dignities heap’d up to them,\\nWe rest your hermits.\\n\\nDUNCAN.\\nWhere’s the Thane of Cawdor?\\nWe cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose\\nTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;\\nAnd his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him\\nTo his home before us.

The same. A Lobby in the Castle.\\n\\n Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers\\n Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well\\nIt were done quickly. If th’ assassination\\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\\nMight be the be-all and the end-all—here,\\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\\nWe’d jump the life to come. But in these cases\\nWe still have judgement here; that we but teach\\nBloody instructions, which being taught, return\\nTo plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice\\nCommends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice\\nTo our own lips. He’s here in double trust:\\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\\nStriding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d\\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\\nThat tears shall drown the wind.—I have no spur\\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\\nVaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself\\nAnd falls on th’ other—\\n\\n Enter Lady Macbeth.\\n\\nHow now! what news?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nHe has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHath he ask’d for me?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nKnow you not he has?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWe will proceed no further in this business:\\nHe hath honour’d me of late; and I have bought\\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss,\\nNot cast aside so soon.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWas the hope drunk\\nWherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\\nWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,\\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\\nLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”\\nLike the poor cat i’ th’ adage?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nPr’ythee, peace!\\nI dare do all that may become a man;\\nWho dares do more is none.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWhat beast was’t, then,\\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\\nHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:\\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\\nHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums\\nAnd dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\\nHave done to this.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf we should fail?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWe fail?\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\\nAnd we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\\n(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey\\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\\nTh’ unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\\nHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt\\nOf our great quell?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBring forth men-children only;\\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\\nNothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,\\nWhen we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two\\nOf his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,\\nThat they have done’t?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWho dares receive it other,\\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\\nUpon his death?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI am settled, and bend up\\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show:\\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\nSCENE I.

Come, let me clutch thee:—\\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\\nAs this which now I draw.\\nThou marshall’st me the way that I was going;\\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\\nMine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses,\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,\\nWhich was not so before.—There’s no such thing.\\nIt is the bloody business which informs\\nThus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world\\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\\nThe curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates\\nPale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder,\\nAlarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,\\nWhose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\nWith Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design\\nMoves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth,\\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\nWhich now suits with it.—Whiles I threat, he lives.\\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\\n\\n [_A bell rings._]\\n\\nI go, and it is done.

I am afraid they have awak’d,\\nAnd ’tis not done.

Macbeth shall sleep no more!”\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\\nYou do unbend your noble strength to think\\nSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water,\\nAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.—\\nWhy did you bring these daggers from the place?\\nThey must lie there: go carry them, and smear\\nThe sleepy grooms with blood.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll go no more:\\nI am afraid to think what I have done;\\nLook on’t again I dare not.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nInfirm of purpose!\\nGive me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead\\nAre but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood\\nThat fears a painted devil.

Lechery, sir, it provokes\\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\\nthe lie, leaves him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\\n\\nPORTER.\\nThat it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nIs thy master stirring?\\n\\n Enter Macbeth.\\n\\nOur knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nGood morrow, noble sir!\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGood morrow, both!\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nNot yet.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\\nI have almost slipp’d the hour.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll bring you to him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\\nBut yet ’tis one.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\\nThis is the door.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI’ll make so bold to call.\\nFor ’tis my limited service.\\n\\n [_Exit Macduff._]\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nGoes the King hence today?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHe does.

Who could refrain,\\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\\nCourage to make’s love known?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nHelp me hence, ho!\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nLook to the lady.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\\n\\nDONALBAIN.\\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\\nLet’s away.

There is none but he\\nWhose being I do fear: and under him\\nMy genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,\\nMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\\nThey hail’d him father to a line of kings:\\nUpon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,\\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\\nThence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,\\nNo son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,\\nFor Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;\\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;\\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\\nAnd champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—\\n\\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\\n\\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\\n\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\n\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nIt was, so please your Highness.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWell then, now\\nHave you consider’d of my speeches? Know\\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\\nIn our last conference, pass’d in probation with you\\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,\\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz’d\\nSay, “Thus did Banquo.”\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nYou made it known to us.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI did so; and went further, which is now\\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\\nAnd beggar’d yours forever?\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nWe are men, my liege.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d file\\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\\nHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive\\nParticular addition, from the bill\\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\\nNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;\\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\\nWhich in his death were perfect.\\n\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\nI am one, my liege,\\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\\nHath so incens’d that I am reckless what\\nI do to spite the world.\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nAnd I another,\\nSo weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,\\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\\nTo mend it or be rid on’t.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBoth of you\\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\\n\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\nTrue, my lord.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\\nAgainst my near’st of life; and though I could\\nWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,\\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\\nMasking the business from the common eye\\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\\n\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\nWe shall, my lord,\\nPerform what you command us.\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nThough our lives—\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,\\nThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight\\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\\nWhose absence is no less material to me\\nThan is his father’s, must embrace the fate\\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\\nI’ll come to you anon.\\n\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\nWe are resolv’d, my lord.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll call upon you straight: abide within.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\\n\\nIt is concluded.

Things without all remedy\\nShould be without regard: what’s done is done.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWe have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it.\\nShe’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\\nBoth the worlds suffer,\\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\\nAfter life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;\\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\\nCan touch him further.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nCome on,\\nGently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;\\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\\nUnsafe the while, that we\\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\\nDisguising what they are.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nYou must leave this.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\\nThou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nBut in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThere’s comfort yet; they are assailable.\\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\\nHis cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons\\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\\nHath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done\\nA deed of dreadful note.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWhat’s to be done?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\\nWhich keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow\\nMakes wing to th’ rooky wood.\\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\\nWhiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.\\nThou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;\\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\\nSo, pr’ythee, go with me.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE III.

But Banquo’s safe?\\n\\nMURDERER.\\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\\nThe least a death to nature.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThanks for that.\\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled\\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\\nNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow\\nWe’ll hear, ourselves, again.\\n\\n [_Exit Murderer._]\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nMy royal lord,\\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\\nThat is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,\\n’Tis given with welcome.

How did you dare\\nTo trade and traffic with Macbeth\\nIn riddles and affairs of death;\\nAnd I, the mistress of your charms,\\nThe close contriver of all harms,\\nWas never call’d to bear my part,\\nOr show the glory of our art?\\nAnd, which is worse, all you have done\\nHath been but for a wayward son,\\nSpiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,\\nLoves for his own ends, not for you.\\nBut make amends now: get you gone,\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\nMeet me i’ th’ morning: thither he\\nWill come to know his destiny.\\nYour vessels and your spells provide,\\nYour charms, and everything beside.\\nI am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend\\nUnto a dismal and a fatal end.\\nGreat business must be wrought ere noon.\\nUpon the corner of the moon\\nThere hangs a vap’rous drop profound;\\nI’ll catch it ere it come to ground:\\nAnd that, distill’d by magic sleights,\\nShall raise such artificial sprites,\\nAs, by the strength of their illusion,\\nShall draw him on to his confusion.\\nHe shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\\nHis hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\\nAnd you all know, security\\nIs mortals’ chiefest enemy.\\n\\n [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]\\n\\nHark!

Forres. A Room in the Palace.\\n\\n Enter Lennox and another Lord.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\\nWhich can interpret farther: only, I say,\\nThing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\nWas pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;\\nWhom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,\\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents tear\\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\\nFor ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,\\nTo hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,\\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\\nThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key\\n(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\\nWhat ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\\nBut, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d\\nHis presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,\\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\nWhere he bestows himself?\\n\\nLORD.\\nThe son of Duncan,\\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\\nLives in the English court and is receiv’d\\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\\nTo ratify the work), we may again\\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\nHath so exasperate the King that he\\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nSent he to Macduff?\\n\\nLORD.\\nHe did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”\\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\\nAnd hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time\\nThat clogs me with this answer.”\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nAnd that well might\\nAdvise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance\\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\\nFly to the court of England, and unfold\\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\\nUnder a hand accurs’d!\\n\\nLORD.\\nI’ll send my prayers with him.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\nSCENE I.

Each new morn\\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows\\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out\\nLike syllable of dolour.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWhat I believe, I’ll wail;\\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;\\nHe hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something\\nYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdom\\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\\nTo appease an angry god.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI am not treacherous.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBut Macbeth is.\\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell:\\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\\nYet grace must still look so.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI have lost my hopes.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\\nWithout leave-taking?—I pray you,\\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\\nWhatever I shall think.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\\nThe title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:\\nI would not be the villain that thou think’st\\nFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp\\nAnd the rich East to boot.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBe not offended:\\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,\\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\\nShall have more vices than it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\\nBy him that shall succeed.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nWhat should he be?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\\nThat, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth\\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar’d\\nWith my confineless harms.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nNot in the legions\\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d\\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nI grant him bloody,\\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\\nThat has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,\\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\\nAll continent impediments would o’erbear,\\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\\nThan such an one to reign.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nBoundless intemperance\\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\\nTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,\\nAnd fall of many kings.

I am yet\\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\\nIs thine and my poor country’s to command:\\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\\nNow we’ll together, and the chance of goodness\\nBe like our warranted quarrel.

It cannot\\nBe call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\\nAre made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems\\nA modern ecstasy.

I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\\nremembrance the more strongly.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t.\\nHell is murky!

What’s the boy Malcolm?\\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\\nAll mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:\\n“Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman\\nShall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes,\\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\\nThe mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,\\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\\n\\n Enter a Servant.\\n\\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!\\nWhere gott’st thou that goose look?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nThere is ten thousand—\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGeese, villain?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nSoldiers, sir.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGo prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\\nThou lily-liver’d boy.

With my sword\\nI’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.\\n\\n [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._]\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThou wast born of woman.\\nBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\\nBrandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\n Alarums. Enter Macduff.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nThat way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!\\nIf thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine,\\nMy wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.\\nI cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\\nAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,\\nOr else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,\\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\\nSeems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!\\nAnd more I beg not.\\n\\n [_Exit. Alarums._]\\n\\n Enter Malcolm and old Siward.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nThis way, my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d:\\nThe tyrant’s people on both sides do fight;\\nThe noble thanes do bravely in the war,\\nThe day almost itself professes yours,\\nAnd little is to do.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWe have met with foes\\nThat strike beside us.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nEnter, sir, the castle.\\n\\n [_Exeunt.

Before my body\\nI throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;\\nAnd damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”\\n\\n [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._]\\n\\n Retreat. Flourish.

Your cause of sorrow\\nMust not be measur’d by his worth, for then\\nIt hath no end.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nHad he his hurts before?\\n\\nROSS.\\nAy, on the front.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nWhy then, God’s soldier be he!\\nHad I as many sons as I have hairs,\\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\\nAnd so his knell is knoll’d.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nHe’s worth more sorrow,\\nAnd that I’ll spend for him.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nHe’s worth no more.\\nThey say he parted well and paid his score:\\nAnd so, God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort.\\n\\n Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHail, King, for so thou art.

That way are they coming.\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nWho knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nFor certain, sir, he is not. I have a file\\nOf all the gentry: there is Siward’s son\\nAnd many unrough youths, that even now\\nProtest their first of manhood.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nWhat does the tyrant?\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nGreat Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.\\nSome say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,\\nDo call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\\nHe cannot buckle his distemper’d cause\\nWithin the belt of rule.\\n\\nANGUS.\\nNow does he feel\\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands;\\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\\nThose he commands move only in command,\\nNothing in love: now does he feel his title\\nHang loose about him, like a giant’s robe\\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nWho, then, shall blame\\nHis pester’d senses to recoil and start,\\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\\nItself for being there?\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nWell, march we on,\\nTo give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:\\nMeet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;\\nAnd with him pour we, in our country’s purge,\\nEach drop of us.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nOr so much as it needs\\nTo dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.\\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\\n\\n [_Exeunt, marching._]\\n\\nSCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\\n\\n Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBring me no more reports; let them fly all:\\nTill Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane\\nI cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?\\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\\nAll mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:\\n“Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman\\nShall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes,\\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\\nThe mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,\\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\\n\\n Enter a Servant.\\n\\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!\\nWhere gott’st thou that goose look?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nThere is ten thousand—\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGeese, villain?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nSoldiers, sir.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGo prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\\nThou lily-liver’d boy.

Give me mine armour.—\\nHow does your patient, doctor?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nNot so sick, my lord,\\nAs she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,\\nThat keep her from her rest.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nCure her of that:\\nCanst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,\\nPluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\\nRaze out the written troubles of the brain,\\nAnd with some sweet oblivious antidote\\nCleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff\\nWhich weighs upon the heart?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nTherein the patient\\nMust minister to himself.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThrow physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it.\\nCome, put mine armour on; give me my staff:\\nSeyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.—\\nCome, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast\\nThe water of my land, find her disease,\\nAnd purge it to a sound and pristine health,\\nI would applaud thee to the very echo,\\nThat should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.—\\nWhat rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,\\nWould scour these English hence?

Within the castle.\\n\\n Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHang out our banners on the outward walls;\\nThe cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength\\nWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie\\nTill famine and the ague eat them up.\\nWere they not forc’d with those that should be ours,\\nWe might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\\nAnd beat them backward home.\\n\\n [_A cry of women within._]\\n\\nWhat is that noise?\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nIt is the cry of women, my good lord.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI have almost forgot the taste of fears.\\nThe time has been, my senses would have cool’d\\nTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\\nWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\\nAs life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;\\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\\nCannot once start me.\\n\\n Enter Seyton.\\n\\nWherefore was that cry?\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nThe Queen, my lord, is dead.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nShe should have died hereafter.\\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\\nLife’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,\\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\\nSignifying nothing.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nThou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nGracious my lord,\\nI should report that which I say I saw,\\nBut know not how to do’t.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWell, say, sir.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,\\nI look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\\nThe wood began to move.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nLiar, and slave!\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nLet me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.\\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\\nI say, a moving grove.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf thou speak’st false,\\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.—\\nI pull in resolution; and begin\\nTo doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,\\nThat lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood\\nDo come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood\\nComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—\\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\\nI ’gin to be aweary of the sun,\\nAnd wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—\\nRing the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!\\nAt least we’ll die with harness on our back.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE VI.

With my sword\\nI’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.\\n\\n [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._]\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThou wast born of woman.\\nBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\\nBrandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\n Alarums. Enter Macduff.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nThat way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!\\nIf thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine,\\nMy wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.\\nI cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\\nAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,\\nOr else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge,\\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\\nSeems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!\\nAnd more I beg not.\\n\\n [_Exit.
